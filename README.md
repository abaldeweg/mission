# baldeweg/mission

Administer a log file of missions.

## Getting Started

Run the command `mission`. The app will create a log file and add a template for every new mission. The details needs to be added to the `missions.yaml` directly via an editor.

The `missions.yaml` file will be created in your home directory. Please, keep the indentation - that's very important for YAML to work correctly.

## Commands

- mission new - Adds a new mission
- mission help - Shows the help
